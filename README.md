  Beeant is basically question platform
 
  ## 🔱Purpose

When i developed this project my main point is make practice with **vue, vuex, vue router** . Actually while i'm learning react, redux, i suddenly understood state management and switched to vue and I tried to understand vuex, understanding was much faster than I thought. Of course i need to make practice with that so i try to developed a basic platform
